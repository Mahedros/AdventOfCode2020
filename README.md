My solutions for Advent of Code 2020

I'm mostly using this a way to teach myself perl, so most of the solutions here are probably not as well thought out as they ought to be. Don't use them as examples of efficient code, well-designed code, or idiomatic perl.

Days 4, 5, and 6 were done in python just to see how fast I could solve the problem, so even though I know the language they still aren't going to be well thought out.
